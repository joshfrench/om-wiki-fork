In this short tutorial we'll see how easy it is to integrate custom
data sources into Om Next applications.

## Setting up

This tutorial uses [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org),
[Figwheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E), and
[Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). You should install
Leiningen and Google Chrome before proceeding. Leiningen is a
standard tool for managing Clojure and ClojureScript library
dependencies. Figwheel is a ClojureScript build tool and REPL that
enables an expressive live programming model well suited for
interactive application development. Figwheel also plays well with
text editors that make traditional REPL integration more challenging.

You can of course use any web browser, but this tutorial only includes
relevant instructions for Chrome to avoid tangential material.

Create a new project and switch into it:

```shell
mkdir om-datascript
cd om-datascript
```

Inside your project directory create a `project.clj`:

```clj
touch project.clj
```

Make it look like the following:

```clj
(defproject om-datascript "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "My first Om program!"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]
                 [org.clojure/clojurescript "1.7.122"]
                 [org.omcljs/om "0.9.0-SNAPSHOT"]
                 [datascript "0.13.1"]
                 [figwheel-sidecar "0.4.0" :scope "provided"]])
```

A Leiningen `project.clj` file simply allows you to declare a variety
of properties about your project. In our the case the most important
is the list of `:dependencies`.

Now create a file `script/figwheel.clj`.

```shell
mkdir script
touch script/figwheel.clj
```

Change `script/figwheel.clj` to look like the following:

```clj
(require '[figwheel-sidecar.repl :as r]
         '[figwheel-sidecar.repl-api :as ra])

(ra/start-figwheel!
  {:figwheel-options {}
   :build-ids ["dev"]
   :all-builds
   [{:id "dev"
     :figwheel true
     :source-paths ["src"]
     :compiler {:main 'om-datascript.core
                :asset-path "js"
                :output-to "resources/public/js/main.js"
                :output-dir "resources/public/js"
                :verbose true}}]})

(ra/cljs-repl)
```

This file describes how to build your ClojureScript project and starts
a REPL. If you are new to ClojureScript you may find this file a bit
overwhelming. If you would like to know more, after this tutorial you
may want to work through the ClojureScript
[Quick Start](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start)
to re-inforce fundamental ClojureScript concepts encountered in this
tutorial.
