## Overview

In Om, you keep all your application state in a single atom (the root atom). Components, however, generally do not care about the entire scope of the application state, but focus on specific parts of it.

Cursors are Om's way to manage a component's focus on just the state data that it needs to operate. Cursors split one big mutable atom into smaller sub-atoms that remain in-sync with the state held in the root atom. Cursors keep a path to the data within the root atom that the component needs to deal with. Sub-cursors are produced by refining the path.

Imagine a text input component: it operates on a single string (within the overall application state), renders it and can return a value back into the application state if the user changes it.

Cursor paths also specify a component's dependencies within the state's atom. Each component gets cursors at construction time and will automatically re-render when the value underneath its cursor changes. Therefore the binding is two-way, so in the example above, changing the string value in the application state will trigger the text input component to re-render itself.

## Accessing cursors

Cursors behave differently during render phase and outside of it.

During the render phase, you treat a cursor as a value, as a regular map or vector. Cursors support all the same interfaces `PersistentMap` and `PersistentVector` support, so you can `get-in`, check for keys, etc. 

Outside of the render phase, you cannot treat cursors as values. Instead, you need to deref it (@) and work with the value returned. Deref returns the actual value beneath the cursor: a map or a vector.

For many reasons, you will want to access cursors outside the root component or access a parent cursor without using a core-async channel. `ref-cursor` and `root-cursor` functions allow you to do this:

```clj
(def state (atom {:name {:first "John" :last "Doe" :little nil}}))

(let [cursor (om/ref-cursor (:name (om/root-cursor state)))]
  (om/update! cursor :little "JD"))
```

## Creating sub-cursors

Root components get cursors created from the atom itself. The atom and all cursors derived from the root cursor stay in sync during all modifications.

You can create sub-cursors from cursors by just calling `get` or `get-in` on them (works only during the render phase). There's a gotcha: if the value returned by `get` is a map or a vector, youâ€™ll get a sub-cursor pointing to it. If it's a primitive value, you'll get a primitive value, not a cursor.

In short:

```clj
(def state (atom {:x 1, :y [:a :b [:c]]}))

(defn root-view [cursor _]
  ...
  (render [_]
     (get cursor :x) ;; 1, value
     (get cursor :y) ;; [:a :b [:c]], cursor with path [:y]
     (get-in cursor [:y 0]) ;; :a, value
     (get-in cursor [:y 2]) ;; [:c], cursor with path [:y 2]
```

This means that you cannot create a component that depends on a single string (like text-input). But you can write a component that depends on a vector of one string:

```clj
(def state (atom {:name ["Igor"]}))

(defn text-input [cursor _]
  ...
  (render [_]
    (dom/input #js {:value (first cursor)}))) 

...
(render [_]
  (om/build text-input (:name app-cursor)))
```

## Making changes via cursors

Cursors can propagate changes back to the original atom. For that purpose, `transact!` calls are used:

```clj
(def state (atom {:click-counter [0]}))

(defn btn-view [cursor _]
  (reify om/IRender
    (render [_]
      (dom/div nil
        (dom/span nil (str "Clicked " (get cursor 0) " times"))
        (dom/button
          #js {:onClick (fn [_]
                          (om/transact! cursor [0] inc))}
			  "Click")))))
```

## Consistency and observability

`transact!` is allowed during and outside of the render phase. When called during the render phase, no `transact!`-ed changes will be visible until the next frame is rendered (next render). That's to keep each rendered frame consistent app-wise.

When rendering, we want to show a consistent view built from a single snapshot of the application state. That's why changes made in the middle of the render phase are not immediately visible for not-yet-rendered components.

Outside the render phase, `deref` returns the current value, while calls to `om.core/value` will return the last rendered value.

## Using multiple cursors

Components might depend on several cursors. Just collect them into a map or a vector and pass it instead of a single cursor:

```clj
(def state (atom {:courses [...], :classes [...], ...}))

(render [_]
  (om/build table-view {:rows (:courses state),
                        :cols (:classes state)})) 
```
